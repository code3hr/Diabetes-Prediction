# Diabetes-Prediction

## Overview
This code uses 3 algorithms(naive bayes,Random forest and logistic regression)  to train pima india data, using scikit-learn, we pick the algorithm that reaches our goal. The goal is to reach and accuracy of 70% or more. More about the implement is in the about.html. So the problem set is, 
<p>use the machine learning workflow to process and transform pima indian data to create a prediction model. This model must predict which people are likely to develop diabetes with 70% or greater accuracy</p>
